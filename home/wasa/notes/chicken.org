* Build system and packaging work

- Missing LICENSE in egg tarballs
- Implement an option for =chicken-install= to not fetch/install any
  dependencies
- http://code.call-cc.org/egg-tarballs/ should be official (see
  http://www.more-magic.net/posts/vcs-independent-distribution.html
  for details)
- Same goes for
  http://code.call-cc.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=chicken-core.git;a=tree;hb=HEAD
- Source links in the wiki (svnwiki hacking?)
- Do something against the hardcoded locations (having a globally
  installed CHICKEN and locally installed libraries doesn't mix as
  they're looked up in the global location unless you use environment
  variables, perhaps an approach Ã  la =pip install --user= or =gem=
  and its user option could work)
- Use <chicken/chicken.h> in generated sources

<Earnestly> wasamasa: All chicken needs is the ability for -p to be an actual prefix and an install location
<Earnestly> wasamasa: So `chicken-install -p /usr "$pkgdir"` for example

* =chicken-src=

The equivalent to =chicken-doc= for (definition) source lookup.

* =moped=

A better MPD library!

* =doodle2=

[[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/doodle][doodle]], but with [[http://libsdl.org/][SDL2]] (as it has numerous benefits, including the
windows behaving more like other toolkit windows with resizing and
whatnot).

* Lispy grep tool

Basically a less snazzy [[http://mlsec.org/joern/][joern]] which parses lispy languages (with
support for archives by using the great [[http://libarchive.org/][libarchive]]), uses a query
language (maybe graph-style or something simpler?) and doesn't require
a database server.

* Fuzzy matcher

That would be nice to have as basis for fuzzy completion inside Emacs,
though [[https://github.com/Fuco1/yafmp][yafmp]] might be good enough (as it is very new though it's still
got the classic plethora of C bugs...).

* Self-hosting [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/spock][spock]] and interpreter

* Linter
