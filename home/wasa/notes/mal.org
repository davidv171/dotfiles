#+TODO: TODO INPROGRESS | DONE

* Feature wish list for implementation candidates

- Reading from stdin, printing to stdout and reading files
- Loading code from other files or better, a module system
- Regex
- An usable type system or dynamic typing
- User-defined exceptions
- Closures
- Higher-order functions or at least function pointers (functors can
  work, but are yucky)
- Apply
- Records/structs/objects
- Numbers(!), arrays(!!), hash tables (can be faked with arrays)
- Measuring time, alternatively shelling out
- Linux support for the CI to work

* Languages to implement MAL in [1/25]

** DONE Emacs Lisp

That was pretty fun and educational.

** INPROGRESS ChucK

A nice audio programming language, with a focus on time.  Incidentally
it appears to have everything needed for implementing MAL in it...

This is harder than expected as it's neither C++ nor Java and not many
people seem to have explored the (buggy) non-audio parts.

** TODO Common Lisp

A serious omission, given the existence of two Scheme (Racket, Guile)
and a Clojure/ClojureScript implementation.

** TODO Pony

The new cool kid on the block.  It appears to have a significantly
advanced type system and compiler, as well as support for
capability-based programming and actors.

** TODO Rebol / Red

A language proposing DSLs as solution to everything with a syntax
reminiscent of Tcl/Forth.

** TODO Smalltalk

The other alternative to Emacs...  It inspired Ruby.

** TODO Self

Looks like Smalltalk, but goes for prototypical OO.  It inspired Io
(which already got an implementation).

** TODO eC / Ecere

Like Tcl/Tk, it's mostly interesting due to its graphics support.  The
language itself is reminiscent of C, but has some higher-level
constructs, such as proper module support.  No exceptions or closures
yet.

** TODO FORTRAN

ORLY?

** TODO COBOL

YARLY

** TODO BCPL

C predecessor

** TODO x86 ASM

Because you just hate yourself and deep down, machine code is untyped...

** TODO PL/I

RMS likes it!

** TODO REXX

Looks like a Tcl/Smalltalk predecessor...

** TODO SNOBOL

Made for string processing!

** TODO MUMPS

Got its own series of The Daily WTF posts...

** TODO ALGOL

Revolutionized classic programming syntax or something

** TODO MODULA-2/MODULA-3

A more modern Pascal?

** TODO Pike

I only know that Emacs supports it...

** TODO Dylan

The other way Lisp could have evolved...

** TODO Squeak/Newsqueak

Language used on Apple's Newton hardware.

** TODO J/K/APL

Yay, array processing.  Somewhat Scheme-inspired.

** TODO Picolisp, Arc, Newlisp

A few "minimal" Lisps that may be different enough from the rest used already.

** TODO CHICKEN

If Guile and Racket made it, why not CHICKEN, too?

** TODO Arrowlisp

Purely symbolic Lisp, so no numbers...
